# Planetary-Weather-Visualizer

# Project Title: Planetary Weather Visualizer

## Project Overview
Create a web application that provides real-time and historical weather data visualization for Earth and other planets. The application will display weather patterns, temperatures, and other atmospheric data on an interactive globe for Earth and simplified representations for planets like Mars, Venus, and Jupiter. This project aims to help scientists and space enthusiasts compare planetary climates.

## Core Features
1. **Interactive 3D Globe**: 
   - Use React.js with a library like Three.js to render a globe, where users can rotate and zoom in on specific areas.
   
2. **Weather Data Integration**: 
   - Use open APIs for real-time Earth weather data (e.g., OpenWeather API) and available NASA datasets for planetary weather data.

3. **Data Visualization**: 
   - Implement charts (using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js) to showcase temperature, humidity, and wind speed trends.

4. **Comparison Mode**: 
   - Allow users to compare Earth’s weather with Mars’ weather using a split-screen interface.

5. **Prediction Feature**: 
   - Use machine learning or predefined models to predict future weather patterns based on historical data.

6. **Space-Themed UI**: 
   - Implement space-themed transitions and multimedia elements like animations in the UI and PowerPoint presentation.

7. **Team Collaboration Tool**: 
   - Integrate a simple chat interface using Node.js or Django for team members to discuss findings or send updates.

## Required Skills
- **React.js/Node.js** or **Django/Python** for the front-end and back-end development.
- **Data Visualization** skills for graphing and charting weather data.
- **PowerPoint Animation** to create an engaging final presentation with space animations.
